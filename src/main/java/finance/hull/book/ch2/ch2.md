Margin requirements:
If two investors get in touch with each other directly and agree to trade an asset in the
future for a certain price, there are obvious risks. One of the investors may regret the
deal and try to back out. Alternatively, the investor simply may not have the financial
resources to honor the agreement. One of the key roles of the exchange is to organize
trading so that contract defaults are avoided. This is where margin accounts come in.

Credit Risk
 The whole purpose of the margining system is to ensure that funds are available to pay
 traders when they make a profit.
 
What Is Credit Risk?
Credit risk is the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual 
obligations. Traditionally, it refers to the risk that a lender may not receive the owed principal and interest, which 
results in an interruption of cash flows and increased costs for collection. Excess cash flows may be written to provide 
additional cover for credit risk. When a lender faces heightened credit risk, it can be mitigated via a higher coupon rate, 
which provides for greater cash flows.
