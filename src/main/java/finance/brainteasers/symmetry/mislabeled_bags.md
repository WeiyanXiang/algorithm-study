3 bags of fruits.
1 has apples, 1 has oranges, 1 has mix of apples and oranges.
each bag has a label (apple, orange or mix) but all bags are mislabeled.

Develop a strategy to identify the bags by taking out minimum number of fruits?
you can take any number of fruits from any bags.

idea:
a - apple
o - orange
m - mix

possible cases:
case:   1 / 2
[a] bag o / m 
[o] bag m / a  
[m] bag a / o 

so take 1 fruit from mix labeled bag, if it is apple, then case 2, otherwise case 1.

Review:
idea is correct. key here is orange and apple are symmetric.
