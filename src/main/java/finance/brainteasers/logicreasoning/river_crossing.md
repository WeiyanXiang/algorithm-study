4 ppl, A,B,C and D need to get across a river. the only way to cross is via bridge, which holds max 2 ppl at a time. 
being dark, they cannot cross without a torch, of which only 1. so each pair can only walk at the speed of the slower 
person. they need to get all of them across to other side asap. A takes 10 mins, B 5 mins, C 2 mins and D 1 min.

what is mini time to get all of them across other side?

17 mins.


key point is to make A 10 and B 5 go together but not make B return, so let C D go first, then D back, then AB go, c back
then CD go -> 2+1+10+2+2 = 17 mins
better than 
using D to company ABC each. which takes 19 mins
