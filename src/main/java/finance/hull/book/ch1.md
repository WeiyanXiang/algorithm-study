# introduction:
Derivatives: financial instrument whose value depends on the value of underlying variable: 
i.e. real asset / financial asset: index/event 

## Exchange traded vs OTC
exchange traded:
buyer -> [Clearing house] <- seller , hence eliminates counter party risk
- highly regulated

## OTC:
buyer <-> seller
OR
buyer -> [Central counter party] <- seller
- less regulated

~ 12 * larger than exchange traded in terms of principal underlying assets.


## Forwards
- no cost to enter
- not creating new money
## Options
- American - anytime exercise (most exchanged options)
- European - last day exercise only (most OTC options)

option has premium: buyer pays seller

call buyer pay $x
call seller receivers $x

for buyer:
- limited loss
- unlimited gain

for seller:
- limited gain (up to premium)
- unlimited loss

that's terrible for seller.


## Type of traders
1. Hedgers: reduce/eliminate risk: i.e. lock-in price
2. Speculators: take on risk (can be engineered), make a price bet (directional) (even no direction)
3. Arbitrageurs: riskless profit, take advantage of mispriced assets (either cross time or place)

(a) 1.5000-1.49000=0.0100 (called 100 pips) * 100,000 = $1k
(b) 1.5000-1.52000=-0.0200 * 100,000 = -$2k

the payoff will always be in the ccy of the 2nd of the pair: i.e. GBPUSD, in this case USD.
