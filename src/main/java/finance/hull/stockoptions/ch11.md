Properties of Stock Options

There are six factors affecting the price of a stock option:
1. The current stock price, S0
2. The strike price, K
3. The time to expiration, T
4. The volatility of the stock price, 
5. The risk-free interest rate, r
6. The dividends that are expected to be paid

part 3 notes from course video: 
Call option:
if St > K => St
if St < K => K

Put option:
if St > K => St
if St < K => K

therefore, Value T = Max(St,K)
No Arbitrage chance as present values are identical

Ce + Ke^-rT = S0 + Pe

the above formula we can determine option prices given one price of option
i.e. 
S0=31
K=30
r=10%
T=3month
Ce=3

3 + 30e^(0.1*0.25) = 31 + Pe

Pe = 1.26
