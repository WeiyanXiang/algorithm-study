     * 1443. Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree
     * <p>
     * upvoted ans: Key idea Whenever you are at a node, say p, you will collect all apples in pâ€™s subtree before
     * returning back to the original root. This will avoid traveling the same path multiple times. Say, root is where
     * we start, p is a node in the tree and p has two children - child1, child2 - and both of them have an apple each.
     * root -> p -> child1 -> p -> child2 -> p -> rootis always going to be better than root-> p -> child1 -> p -> root
     * -> p -> child2 -> p -> root.
     * <p>
     * So now it becomes a simple graph traversal problem, particularly DFS where we visit all children of the node
     * first and then go back the other nodes.
     * <p>
     * Algorithm
     * <p>
     * Because you have the list of edges, construct the graph first to have a better representation of the graph. For
     * each node, check if any of its children have apples and find the total cost in terms of time in seconds of
     * collecting those. If there is at least one child with an apple, then we have to collect it. So we will also have
     * to add the cost (time required) of reaching that node. return the total time.
