5 pirates looted 100 coins. they agree to divide the loot:
most senior will propose a distribution and all inc himself will vote, 
    if > 50% (3 pirates in this case) -> accept
    if not, most senior will fed to shark and process starts over with next most senior pirate etc
the process repeated until a plan is approved. Assume all pirates are rational: they want to stay alive first and to get
as much gold as possible second. also they want to have fewer pirates on the boat if given a choice between otehrwise equal 
outcomes. 

How will the gold conis be divided in the end?

100

start: 
pirate 1 -> 100 
add pirate 2 more senior -> 2 gets 100 as he get himself vote for 50%
add pirate 3 -> 3 gives 1 one coin so 3->99 and 1->1
add pirate 4 -> 4 gives 2 one coin so 4-> 99 and 2->1
add pirate 5 -> 5 gives 3 and 1 each one coin so 5->98, 3->1, 1->1
otherwise the pirate who gets one coin wont get anything.
