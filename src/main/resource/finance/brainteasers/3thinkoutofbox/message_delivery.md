you need to communicate with colleague in greenwich via a messager service
the service is not secure, so anything inside an unlocked box wil be lost (inc any locks you place inside the box)
the high-security padlocks you and your colleague each use have only one key which the person placing the lock owns.

How can you securely send a doc to your colleague?

idea:
- letter must be in secure box.
- c - colleague, i - me
- c send secure box A 
- i put letter in and lock it and send to c
- c has key to open up and read

same applies to c -letter-> i

Solution:

- c puts letter in and send locked box to i
- i put my lock on that box again (so 2 locks on the box)
- c receives and remove his lock (my own lock in the box) and send back
- i receive and unlock my own lock, done

review:
my idea doesnt seem the expectation of question as box has to be locked a pre-condition here
