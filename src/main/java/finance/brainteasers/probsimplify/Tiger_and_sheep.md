100 tigers and 1 sheep on a magic island only has grass. Tigers can eat grass but they would rather eat sheep. Assume:
- each time only 1 tiger can eat 1 sheep and that tiger itself will become a sheep after it eats sheep
- all tigers are smart and rational and want to survive

how will the sheep be eaten?

[s] means tiger eats sheep and becomes sheep
t s -> [s]
tt s -> tts
ttt s -> tt[s]
tttt s -> tttt s
t...t s -> 100* + [s]

if there are 3 t, s will be eaten since each t will realize that once it chanegs to a sheep, will be 2 t left and 
it will not be eaten.
if there are 4 t, each t understands that if it eats sheep it will turn to a sheep, since there are 3 other tigers, it 
will be eaten, so to guarantee the highest likelihood of survival, no t will eat sheep

so if number of t is even, no sheep eaten, if number is odd, sheep will be eaten.
