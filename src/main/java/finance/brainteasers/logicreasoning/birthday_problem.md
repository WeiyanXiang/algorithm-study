you and colleagues know boss A birthday is 1 of 10 dates:
Mar 3, Mar 5, Mar 8
Jun 4, Jun 7
Sep 1, Sep 5
Dec 1, Dec 2, Dec 8

A told u  only the month of his birthday and told your colleague C only the day, after that you first said: i dont know 
A's birthday; C doesnt know it either. after hearing, C replied: i dont know As birthday but now I know it. u smiled and 
said: now i know it too. After looking at the 10 dates and hearing your comments, your admin assistant wrote down A's 
birthday without asking any questions. So what did assistant write?

Sep 1.

reasoning:
2 and 7 are unique days so if u sure c doesnt know the birthday, then Jun and Dec dates both crossed out because i.e. 
if month is Jun, the day C was told of may have been 2, if month is Dec, the day C was told of may have been 7. 

further, in Mar and Sep, 5 is duplicate and since C figures out the date, so crossed out Mar 5 and Sep 5.

now Mar 4, Mar 5 (2 * Mar) and Sep 1 are left. Since u dont know the date in the beginning, the date must be Sep 1.
