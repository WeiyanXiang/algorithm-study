2 ropes, each of which takes 1 hour to burn. but either rope has dif densities at dif points, so no guarantee of 
consistency in the time it takes dif sections within the rope to burn. 

how do you use 2 ropes to measure 45 mins?

idea:
make sure 4 burning point on first rope: cut in half and once one sub rope burn down, cut the other part in half and 
repeat doing it to ensure 4 burning point -> once fully burned, it will be 15 mins passed.
and meanwhile have second rope burning.
Once first rope fully burnt, the left of second rope is 45 mins


Solution given:
rope 1 burn at both ends, -> 30 mins
meanwhile rope 2 burn at one end,
as soon as rope 1 burn out, burn the other end of rope 2, which takes around 15 mins
in total it is 45 mins
