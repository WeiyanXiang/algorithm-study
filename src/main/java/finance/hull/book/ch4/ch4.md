# Interest Rates
### Types of Rates
These include mortgage rates, deposit rates, prime borrowing
rates, and so on

The higher the credit risk, the
higher the interest rate that is promised by the borrower.

Interest rates are often expressed in basis points. One basis point is 0.01% per annum.

#### Treasury Rates
Treasury rates are the rates an investor earns on Treasury bills and Treasury bonds.
These are the instruments used by a government to borrow in its own currency.

It is usually assumed that there is no chance that a government will default
on an obligation denominated in its own currency. Treasury rates are therefore totally
risk-free rates in the sense that an investor who buys a Treasury bill or Treasury bond is
certain that interest and principal payments will be made as promised.

####LIBOR
LIBOR is short for *London Interbank Offered Rate*
