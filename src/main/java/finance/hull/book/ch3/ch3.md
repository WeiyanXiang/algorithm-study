Many of the participants in futures markets are hedgers. Their aim is to use futures
markets to reduce a particular risk that they face. This risk might relate to fluctuations
in the price of oil, a foreign exchange rate, the level of the stock market, or some other
variable. A perfect hedge is one that completely eliminates the risk. Perfect hedges are
rare. For the most part, therefore, a study of hedging using futures contracts is a study
of the ways in which hedges can be constructed so that they perform as close to perfect
as possible.


### Basic Principles
When an individual or company chooses to use futures markets to hedge a risk, the
objective is usually to take a position that neutralizes the risk as far as possible.
#### Short Hedges
A short hedge is a hedge, such as the one just described, that involves a short position in
futures contracts. A short hedge is appropriate when the hedger already owns an asset
and expects to sell it at some time in the future

basics: short meaning: short selling is opening a position indicating selling it first (borrowing from broker first) 
and pay back later hoping the price goes down when buy back. 
#### Long Hedges
A long hedge is appropriate when a company knows it will have to purchase a
certain asset in the future and wants to lock in a price now.

### Arguments for and against hedging
- for nonfinancial companies, make sense for hedging as they have no particular skills in predicting interest rates, 
exchange rate or commodity prices.

#### Hedging and Shareholders
One argument sometimes put forward is that the shareholders can, if they wish, do the
hedging themselves. They do not need the company to do it for them. This argument is,
however, open to question. It assumes that shareholders have as much information as the
company’s management about the risks faced by a company. In most instances, this is
not the case.
One thing that shareholders can do far more easily than a corporation is diversify
risk.

#### Hedging and Competitors
Competitive pressures
within the industry may be such that the prices of the goods and services produced by
the industry fluctuate to reflect raw material costs, interest rates, exchange rates, and so
on. A company that does not hedge can expect its profit margins to be roughly
constant. However, a company that does hedge can expect its profit margins to
fluctuate!

The example emphasizes the importance of looking at the big picture when hedging.
All the implications of price changes on a company’s profitability should be taken into
account in the design of a hedging strategy to protect against the price changes.

#### hedging can lead to a worse outcome
Mostly refer to when short and price goes up, your profit limited.
When long and price goes down, your profit limited.

###Basis Risk
In practice, hedging is often not quite as
straightforward as this. Some of the reasons are as follows:
1. The asset whose price is to be hedged may not be exactly the same as the asset
underlying the futures contract.
2. The hedger may be uncertain as to the exact date when the asset will be bought
or sold.
3. The hedge may require the futures contract to be closed out before its delivery
month.

The basis in a hedging situation is as folows:
```
Basis = Spot price of asset to be hedged - Futures price of contract used
```

Note that basis changes can lead to an improvement or a worsening of a hedger’s
position. Consider a company that uses a short hedge because it plans to sell the
underlying asset. If the basis strengthens (i.e., increases) unexpectedly, the company’s
position improves because it will get a higher price for the asset after futures gains or
losses are considered; if the basis weakens (i.e., decreases) unexpectedly, the company’s
position worsens. For a company using a long hedge because it plans to buy the asset,
the reverse holds. If the basis strengthens unexpectedly, the company’s position worsens
because it will pay a higher price for the asset after futures gains or losses are
considered; if the basis weakens unexpectedly, the company’s position improves.


*cross hedging*: The asset that gives rise to the hedger’s exposure is sometimes different from the
asset underlying the futures contract that is used for hedging. This is known as *cross
hedging*

#### Choice of contract
This choice has two components:
1. The choice of the asset underlying the futures contract
2. The choice of the delivery month.

### Cross hedging
Cross hedging occurs when the two assets are different.
for example, an airline that is concerned about the future price
of jet fuel. Because jet fuel futures are not actively traded, it might choose to use heating
oil futures contracts to hedge its exposure.


The *hedge ratio* is the ratio of the size of the position taken in futures contracts to the
size of the exposure

#### Calculating the Minimum Variance Hedge Ratio
ΔS: Change in spot price, S, during a period of time equal to the life of the hedge
ΔF: Change in futures price, F, during a period of time equal to the life of the
hedge.
