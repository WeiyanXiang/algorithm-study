Casino offers normal deck of 52 cards.
Rule: you turn over 2 cards each time. for each pair, 
if both black, they go to dealer's pile. 
if both red, they go to your pile. 
if 1 black 1 red, they are discarded.
process repeated until you two go through all 52 cards. If you have more cards in pile, you win $100; otherwise (inc ties)
you get nothing. The casino allows you to negotiate the price you want to pay for the game. 

how much you willing to pay to play the game?


My thinking:
52 cards -> 50 color cards -> 25 black + 25 red
2 cards each time -> 25 times in total
expectation of I win is:

possible cases of pair:
1b 1r
1r 1b
2b
2r
therefore:
tie -> 0.5
win -> 0.25
lost -> 0.25

as per game rule:
lost -> 0.75    
win -> 0.25     - 100

so expectation of win is -> 25, so as long as price < 25, could give it a go.

Actual solution:
No matter how the cards arranged, you and dealer will always have same number of cards in your piles. because each pair 
of discarded cards have 1b 1r, so equal num of r and b cards are discarded. as a result num of r cards left and num of b 
cards always same. the dealer always win.
