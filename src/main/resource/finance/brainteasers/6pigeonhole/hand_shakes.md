you are invited to a welcome party with 25 fellow team members. each of them shakes hands with you to welcome you.
Since a number of people in the room have not met each other, theres a lot of random handshaking among others as well
if you dont know the total no. of handshakes, can you say with certainty that there are at least 2 people present who 
shook hands with exactly the same number of people?

idea:
didnt really get the point of questions,
if given large number of hand shaking, each one will have shook with all others, then it fulfilled that there are at 
least 2 people present who shook hands with exactly the same number of people, in which the number is 25.

but i dont know the totle no of handshakes.
So not sure how to approach this question

Solution: https://www.youtube.com/watch?h=AXBLn1TQwR8 check this youtube, good explanation
there are 26 people in party and each shakes hands with from 1 to 25 people.
in other words, 26 pigeons with 25 holes, so at least two people must have shaken
with exactly the same number of people.

review:
the point is everyone shakes hand with you!
so there are 25 holes and 26 people.
