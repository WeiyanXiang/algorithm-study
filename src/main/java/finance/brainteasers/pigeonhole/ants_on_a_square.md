51 ants on a square with side length of 1, if you have a glass with a radius of 1/7.
Can you put glass at a position on the square to guarantee that the glass encompasses at least 3 ants?

idea:
as per generalised pigeon hole:
n holes
nm+1 = 51 pigeons
m+1 pigeon = 3 sharing
then m=2,n=25

we can divide the square into 25 holes.
each with be with 1/5 length, a 1/7 radius cycle is larger than 1/5 length square, so valid 
a circle with radius r can cover a square with side length up to âˆš2 * r

Solution: as per above
