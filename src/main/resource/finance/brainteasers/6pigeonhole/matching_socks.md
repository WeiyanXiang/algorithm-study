your drawer contains 2 red socks, 20 yellow socks and 31 blue socks.
you just randomly grab a number of socks but out of the draw and try to find a matching pair.
Assume each sock has equal probability of being selected,

what is minimum number of socks you need to grab in order to guarantee a pair of socks of the same color?

idea:
2 r 20y 31b = 53 socks in total.
at least 4 will guarantee I can at least have 1 pair same color out

solution:
when you have 3 colors, == 3 pigeon holes,
by the principle, you will need to have 3+1=4 socks to guarantee that at least 2 socks have the same color.
